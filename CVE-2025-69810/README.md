## 🛠️ Technical Description

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in **Dradis Framework** Community Edition (CE) and Professional Edition (PE) **v4.19.0** allows remote authenticated attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript via the Board name or List name fields. The vulnerability exists in RecoverableRevisionPresenter **(app/presenters/recoverable_revision_presenter.rb)** where user-controlled input is concatenated without HTML encoding and subsequently marked as html_safe, bypassing Rails' automatic XSS protection.

## 🛠️ How It Works

An authenticated user can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into Board or List name fields via the web interface or API. The malicious payload is stored in the database and executes in any user's browser when they view the Trash page (/projects/{id}/trash), leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or other client-side attacks.
