## 🛠️ Technical Description

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in **Dradis Framework** Community Edition (CE) and Professional Edition (PE) **v4.19.0** allows remote authenticated attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript via the Board name or List name fields. The vulnerability exists in RecoverableRevisionPresenter **(app/presenters/recoverable_revision_presenter.rb)** where user-controlled input is concatenated without HTML encoding and subsequently marked as html_safe, bypassing Rails' automatic XSS protection.

### Affected Code
The vulnerable code is located in the following file:
- [`recoverable_revision_presenter.rb`](https://github.com/dradis/dradis-ce/blob/develop/app/presenters/recoverable_revision_presenter.rb)

### How It Works
1. An attacker creates a malicious HTML form or script designed to perform a privileged action (e.g., changing user roles).
2. The attacker tricks an authenticated user into visiting a page containing the malicious form/script.
3. The user’s browser sends a request to the vulnerable application, executing the privileged action without the user’s consent.

---

## ⚠️ Impact
If exploited, this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to:
- Escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities.
- Perform actions on behalf of authenticated users without their knowledge.

---

## 🛡️ Remediation
The vendor has been notified, and the issue has been patched. To mitigate this vulnerability:
1. **Update** to the latest version of Sell Done Storefront.
2. **Implement anti-CSRF tokens** in all state-changing requests.
3. **Validate and sanitize** all user inputs to prevent similar vulnerabilities.
